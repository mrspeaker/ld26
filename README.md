# School of Thought

A game by Mr Speaker for LD26


## Notes

* (Puzzle) Platformer
* Evil surrealist captures your minimalist girlfried, traps her somewhere inside his infamous "School of Thought".
* Levels are all white so you can't see your location
* Ray cast in the direction you are looking (mouse control) lets you feel the outline of the level
* Shooting "paint" will stick on the blocks and define it.
* Different paints:
	- watercolors (disolves quickly back to white)
	- inks (splatter and stay)
	- acrylics (magic: makes EVERY block of that type to be painted the same)
	- paint bomb (explodes and paints in all directions.)

* Surrealist elements in the levels
	- view become kalidascopic (rotates x degrees)
	- view becomes split view into squares
	- view rotates (ladders are wobbly and have curves)

* baddies....
* levels are a bit crazy: elevators, slides, teleporters, curved ladders
